# Nemo-Game
A 2D game developed in Unity that showcases my skills in game design, C# scripting, and UI implementation. Features dynamic obstacle generation, scoring systems, and responsive player controls. Created as a demonstration of my ability to build engaging and functional gameplay experiences.
